I am writing down this post at 9:32pm of July 6, 2019, and I am wondering what I will be like in 3, 5, 10 years from today.

I do not know yet.

The only thing that I know for sure is that I am going to be proud for what I have accomplished.

This portfolio - or perhaps blog - of mine will motivate me to study consistently the Data world.

As I am an eager learner and I have a proclivity for Data Visualization and Data Modeling, I just can't wait how this will end up.

## *Why starting a blog?*

There are three main reasons that led me to start this journey to Data literacy, namely:

1. keep learning
2. collect my projects for reference
3. share my knowledge with other data geeks

I know it will be tough and for this I want to thank you my family for supporting me.

## *What does a Data Scientist do?*

The definition of a *"Data Scientist"* may refer to a number of skills.

Long story short, a Data Scientist:

+ knows how to code
+ has a good understanding of maths, algorithms, and statistics
+ gains insights from data based on business expertise

The following [Venn diagram of Data Science by Drew Conway](http://drewconway.com/zia/2013/3/26/the-data-science-venn-diagram) makes the point of what Data Science stands for.

$$Data Science = Computer Science + Maths + Business Expertise$$

Also, the Data Scientist is capable of making predictions and drawing inferences for future outcomes by asking the right questions, collecting and cleaning the data, and effectively visualize and communicate insights.

I guess this job does feel as exciting to you as it does to me!

Please enjoy reading about my journey and have fun with Data.
