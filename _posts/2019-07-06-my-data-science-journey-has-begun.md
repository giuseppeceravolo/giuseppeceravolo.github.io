# *Giuseppe Ceravolo thinking about himself in the future...*

I am writing down this post at 9:32pm of July 6, 2019, and I am wondering what I will be like in 3, 5, 10 years from today.

I do not know yet.

The only thing that I know for sure is that I am going to be proud for what I have accomplished.

The portfolio - or perhaps blog - of mine will motivate me to study consistently the Data Science world.

As I am an eager learner and I have a proclivity for Data Visualization and Data Modeling, I just can't wait how this will end up.

## *Why starting a blog?*

There are 2 main reaonns that led me to start this journey to Data Science literacy, namely:

1. keep learning
2. collect my projects for reference
3. share my knowledge with other data geeks

I know it will be tough and for this I want to thank you my family for supporting me.

## *What does a Data Scientist do?*

The definition of a *"Data Scientist"* may refer to a number of skills.

Long story short, a Data Scientist:

+ knows how to code
+ has a good understanding of maths, algorithms, and statistics
+ gains insights from data based on business expertise

The following Venn diagram by Drew Conway makes the point of what Data Science stands for.

Also, the Data Scientist is capable of making predictions and drawing inferences for future outcomes by asking the right questions, collecting and cleaning the data, and effectively visualize and communicate insights.

I guess this job does feel as exciting to you as it does to me!

Please enjoy reading about my journey and have fun with Data Science.
