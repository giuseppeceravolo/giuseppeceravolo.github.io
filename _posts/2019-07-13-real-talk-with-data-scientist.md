I recently stumbled upon two video interviews published by [Springboard](https://www.springboard.com/) of a [real talk with a Google Data Scientist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbNegqgZKCw) and another [real talk with an Instagram Data Scientist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYZJxhYjBE8&list=).

After watching these two videos I found myself wondering about *what it means to me to be a Data Scientist*.

Let's discuss about the characteristics of a Data Scientist.

## *How can you know if you are a "good fit" as a Data Scientist?*

Simply put, my understanding of working in the *"Big Data"* industry is about the ability to leverage

+ Computer Science
+ Mathematical Modeling
+ Data Visualization

in order to solve *"Big Questions"*.

Note that **the work of a Data Scientist is not a one-man job** at all. In fact, you should carefully conceive the idea that [the best Data Scientists get out to talk to people](https://hbr.org/2017/01/the-best-data-scientists-get-out-and-talk-to-people) - and that's what I like the most about my daily job.

## *Why I work as a Data Scientist?*

I can point out three main reasons why I chose to develop a carrier as a Data Scientist:

1. High impact on business
2. Huge variety of work
3. Good career opportunities

Working as a Data Scientist is mostly about **Problem Solving** and the **ultimate goal of a Data Scientist is to solve real-world problems**.

It does sound pretty cool, I know, but there's one little caveat to consider.

You must be aware that

> Models are a dime a dozen.

What I mean is that any Data Scientist can produce thousands of fancy models in a matter of days.

They key and most-rewarding component of a Data Scientist job is

>To know how to engineer features and implement the (only one) model into your company's pipeline to deliver value

I hope it all makes sense to you. Please feel free to contact me - I'd love to have a talk with you!
