I am a highly motivated Data & Analytics Consultant holding an MSc in Management Engineering with solid experience on value creation projects through data-driven solutions applied in information-intensive industries (e.g. luxury, logistics, e-commerce, real estate, financial services).

I fell in love with Python when working at a FinTech startup where I developed a MachineÂ Learning model to forecast real estate auction outcomes in Italy.

I enjoy projects about Data Warehousing, Data Mining, Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Visualization, and Machine Learning.

I built this website in part as a blog for my reference and in part as a means to share my notes.

I hope you enjoy reading my website and find it useful.
